Digital Drum

Overview
For Senior Design Project in EE 403 at Penn State, we designed a Digital Drum. 
A Piezo contact microphone was used to measure the input signals of each hits. 
Using a LPCXpresso54608 development board, the input signals from the microphone 
was converted to output signals, which produce drum sounds. The board adjusts output volume or
produces a rim-shot sound corresponding to the intensity of each hits. Â 

Keil microVision was used to code the development board.
